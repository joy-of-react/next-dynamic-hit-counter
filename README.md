## Hit Counter exercise

Once again, we're working on our hit counter!

This time, everything works swell when we run in development (`npm run dev`), but things don't quite work when we try to build for production (`npm run build` and then `npm run start`). The number of hits appears fixed in place, and doesn't increase when we refresh the page.

Your mission is to fix this bug!
